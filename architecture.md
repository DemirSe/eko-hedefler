# Project Architecture

This project is being developed in a step-by-step manner, starting with a basic webpage for helping user about eco goals and gradually adding additional features.

## Overview

- The application is centered on helping users track and reduce their carbon footprint, promoting eco-friendly behaviors.
- It is designed to evolve into a comprehensive platform integrating features such as personalized reminders, goal setting, statistics, social sharing, and community engagement.

## Architecture Components

### Docker

- The project will utilize Docker for containerization, ensuring consistency across development and production environments.
- Each service (e.g., web server, database, etc.) will run in its own container to isolate dependencies.

### Traefik Reverse Proxy

- Traefik will serve as the reverse proxy for managing incoming traffic and routing requests to the appropriate containers.
- It will handle automatic HTTPS certificate management and provide configurability for scaling.

### Basic Webpage for Carbon Footprint Calculations

- The initial implementation will deliver a basic webpage that enables users to calculate their carbon footprint from input data.
- This foundational component will serve as the basis for integrating additional environmental metrics and interactive features in the future.

## Future Plans

- As development progresses, additional features outlined in goals.md will be integrated to enrich user experience.
- The architecture is designed for modular growth, allowing new functionalities to be added with minimal disruption.
- Focus will remain on maintainability, scalability, and ease of integration as the platform expands.
